__Day 7: Saturday__

Directing Traffic is difficult, however somebody has to do it. Our unit Arrived today, and we finally start our mission. Step one prepare all of our equipment for the field. Its like camping however instead of just tents and roughing it we stand up an entire network. So we have to prepare for every contingent. Kind of like packing up all the equipment possibly needed to succeed our mission. After we made our wish list we coordinated and directed traffic in order to get all the gear in its appropriate site. Since we cant just rip our equipment out. We have to stage it and we should move our equipment in the morning.

After work things got more interesting. One of our soldiers is in quarantine because he has bronchitus from his civilian job. and another one decided it was a good idea to go out drinking. About 1:40am the bay woke up to him vomiting in his sleep and did not wake up for a few minutes as we had to wake him up. The guy is in alot of trouble now and will recieve diciplinary action. <ugh> 

__Day 8: Sunday__
Today was a Fiasco one pain point after another. PT in the morning, and after that we are to load our equipment into the LMTV (Big Truck). We finally got the equipment loaded in the truck after one of our Soldiers couldnt figure out how to load and secure our equipment. I had to go in there and rearrange our hodgepodge of servers and equipment so it fit and could mount correctly.

Finally we are ready to roll on out. Everyone is online except for my section. Which was waiting on a truck. The convoy was approved to roll out without us. So we watched them roll out only to find out one of their trucks was DeadLined due to an airbrake issue on the attached water buffalo trailer (the units water for the field). So myself and my best soldier went to go help out the supply NCO so we can get water in the field.

We got close to fixing it after trying everything from using gloves plastic bags and duct tape. Basically mcguivering it. We had an idea of using earplugs thinking it would expand and fill the hole where air was leaking out. It actually worked for like 1 mile but failed after we tried to prevent it from flying off in the event it failed. We finally fixed the gap, by tighening the valve down a bit (No really thats all it was).

We setup our tent and went to chow. I got approved to go home for the night. So I am pretty stoked to sleep in my bed.
